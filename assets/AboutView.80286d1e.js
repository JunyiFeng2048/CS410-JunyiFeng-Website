I moved to the United States in 2017 and living in Portland for 5 years. I graduated from David Douglas High School in 2019, and now I'm an undergraduate computer science student at Portland State University and expected to graduate in June 2023. I am interested in Software Engineering and Gaming Development. I am passionate about bringing the worlds I imagine to life. So I am always curious to learn more about new technologies and creative coding, and I also love learning about design. Movies are my greatest hobby.
