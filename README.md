# Project

This project is my final project in PSU CS410 Fall 2022. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate what we learned in class and create a personal website. The website should include A Navbar that navigates to the different sections(About, Previous Work, Projects, and Contact). I chose to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The theme colors are white and gray. I checked the site on Chrome and Firefox with screen sizes of 414px, 768px and 1024px.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
